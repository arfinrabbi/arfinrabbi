                        <h3>CornerStone Property Services</h3>
                        <p>For this project, I was tasked with creating a professional and modern logo for CornerStone Property Services, a company specializing in real estate and property management solutions. The goal was to design a brand identity that reflects trust, stability, and sophistication while remaining clean and versatile for different applications.</p>
                        <p>The color palette was carefully chosen, featuring three shades of blue combined with a subtle gray. Blue conveys reliability, trust, and professionalism—qualities essential in the property services industry—while gray adds balance and modernity.</p>

                        <p>I created a clean and modern logo for Bowl Society, a brand specializing in healthy offerings such as acai bowls, poke, smoothies, and coffee. The client wanted a design that felt fresh, contemporary, and versatile across different platforms and packaging.</p>
                        <p>The logo was designed in a minimal black and white palette to highlight simplicity and timeless appeal. This approach ensures the brand identity remains adaptable while keeping the focus on the natural and colorful products they serve.</p>

                        <p>The logo features vector pizza slices arranged in a round shape, symbolizing both the product and the idea of sharing. The chosen colors—red, yellow, brown, and green—represent fresh ingredients like tomato, cheese, crust, and herbs.</p>

                        <p>Three variations were developed — black, dark green, and white on black — ensuring the logo works seamlessly in print, packaging, and digital use. The clean design style reflects both the playful nature of the drink and the welcoming vibe of the coffee shop.</p>
